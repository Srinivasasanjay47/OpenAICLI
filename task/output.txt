So this is how much progress has been made. You know, really, I want to be clear, like there is a world of difference between Chad GPT and GPT-4. If you've played with Chad GPT and you were not convinced, I encourage you not to stop there, okay? So, of course, you know, you might still say, okay, this is not that great, but one of the things that we're gonna see is that GPT-4 is intelligent enough also to use tools. So what you can say is you can respond to it and say, hey, you know what, I don't like your drawings that much, you know, can you try to improve it, and you know, I have heard about these diffusion models, maybe you can use one of them. So what it's gonna do is it's gonna say, yeah, sure, can you, you know, go on this diffusion model website and, you know, plug in my picture and ask it to improve it, and, you know, this is what you will get, okay? So this is the unicorn of GPT-4 when it's allowed to use tools also, okay? So you can see where this could potentially go. Now again, as I said, you know, I don't want to stop there.
