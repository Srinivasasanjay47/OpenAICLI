ok so so so this is how much progress has been made you know really I I want to be clear like there is a word of difference between charge dept and GPT for if you play with charge apt and you were not convinced I encourage you not to stop there ok so of course you know you you might still say ok this is not that great but one of the things that we're gonna see is that GPT for is intelligent enough also to use tools so what you can say is you can respond to it and say hey you know what I don't like your drawing that much you know can you try to improve it and you know I've heard about this diffusion models maybe you can use one of them so What it's gonna do is that it's gonna say yeah sure can you you know go on this diffusion model website and you know plug in my picture and ask it to improve it and you know this is what you will get ok so this is the Unicorn of GPT 4 when it's allowed to use tools also ok so you you can see where where this could potentially go now again as I said you know I don't want to stop there
